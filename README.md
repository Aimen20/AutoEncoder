# AutoEncoder

This project showcases the basic implementation of AutoEncoder. The Dataset used is TenserFlow's Fashion MNIST

Encoders are used to generate reduced feature set of actual data while decoders re constructs the original data from the reduced features. The accuracy of reconstructed data depends on modified dimentionality and training epochs.
